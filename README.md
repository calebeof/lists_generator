# lists_generator
An exercise list generator for my To-Do Exercise Lists in Evernote. 
The program asks the numbers of the questions that you want to generate and if there is letters in the questions that you have to answer.
Then, this program generates you an ENML code that you can paste in a new note in your account, but only using ENML Editor (http://enml2.herokuapp.com).
